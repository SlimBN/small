# Small

Because somtimes [Medium](http://medium.com) is too large.

----

Small aims to be an easy to use and install web application which provides
users with a Medium-esque service, but for individuals and small groups
instead of everyone in the world.

----

In its current state, Small is based off of an older project, Branch. As it's
currently exactly the same as Branch (as in, just pulled the source), there
are references to the name "Branch" all over. That'll change, just like a good
deal of other things.

If you're looking for more information on both how it currently works, and how
it *should* work in the future, check out the commit log (most commits are
fairly descriptive) from before April, and the `./spec` directory, which has a
bunch of design documents.
